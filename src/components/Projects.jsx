          Thanks for reviewing my projects — each one is a story of late-night
          caffeine, countless debug logs, and tiny victories. Just like every ;
          matters in code, every project here shaped how I think, build, and
          break things (intentionally or not). Hope you enjoyed the journey as
          much as I enjoyed surviving it!
